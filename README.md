Introduction
------------

EPCA: **e**xploratory **P**rinciple **C**omponent **A**nalysis (PCA) for data with inner nature of sparsity. It contains a series of implementations, including sparse {PCA, independent component analysis (ICA)} via **s**parse **m**ultivariate **d**ecomposition (SMD). The SMD is defined as the following optimization of matrix *X* into the form of *Z**B**Y*<sup>‚ä§</sup>, where *Z* and *Y* is sparse, and *B* is low-rank.
