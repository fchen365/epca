The goal of **e**xploratory **p**rincipal **c**omponent **a**nalysis (EPCA) is to comprehend any data with sparsity nature. 
The EPCA features sparse PCA via the **s**parse **m**ultivariate **d**ecomposition (SMD).
The SMD factorizes a data matrix $X$ into the form of $Z B Y^\top$, where $Z$ and $Y$ are sparse and orthogonal, and $B$ is low-rank.
This is accomplished by minimizing the reconstruction error under the [Frobenius norm](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html).

## Installation

You can install the released version of epca from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("epca")
```

or the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fchen365/epca")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem.
