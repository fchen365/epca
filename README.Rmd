## Introduction 

EPCA: **e**xploratory **P**rinciple **C**omponent **A**nalysis (PCA) for data with inner nature of sparsity. 
It contains a series of implementations, including sparse {PCA, independent component analysis (ICA)} via **s**parse **m**ultivariate **d**ecomposition (SMD).
The SMD is defined as the following optimization of matrix $X$ into the form of $Z B Y^\top$, where $Z$ and $Y$ is sparse, and $B$ is low-rank.
