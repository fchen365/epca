**`shrink`**: The `shrink` option specifies the shrinkage operator to use.
Currently, there are two build-in options---"soft"- and "hard"-thresholding.
The "soft"-thresholding universally reduce all elements and sets the small elements to zeros. 
The "hard"-thresholding only sets the small elements to zeros.
